# Software Engineering Git Assignment

## by Joe O’Mahony (W21788075)

This  **remote repository**  encompasses the file changes associated with the final assignment (project) in the  **Software Engineering**  module.

* Each iteration of the document adds various components, or parts of components (as noted in the ordered list).
* Two **branches** are used, a _master_ branch and a _development_ branch. 
* Five **pull requests** have been merged, one is open.
* Two **issues** are outstanding, one is solved. 
* A **merge commit** was used for the layout of the document (provided on [Moodle](https://moodle.wit.ie/course/view.php?id=209446)). 
* **Rebases** (or, _rebase and merges_) were used for the subsequent iterations to preserve the full history and keep the **master branch** clean.

As of 21/October/2024, the following components have been integrated:

 1. 💼 Product Vision 
 2. 🙋‍♀️ User Personas 
 3. 🏞️ Scenarios

**Note:** _git diff_ tracks changes in _text_ files, but not in the _docx_ format used for the final assignment. No issue was raised as this can't be remedied. In future projects, I will begin to use git at an earlier stage to avoid the file naming convention that I used in this project, and I will use markdown or plain text to enable _git diff_.
